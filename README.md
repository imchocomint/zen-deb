Extract the downloaded file and install the .deb from there.

## Running
To launch Zen Browser, run `zen` or `zen-bin` from the terminal

To update, run `zen-updater` from the terminal. Note that this will not update your Debian package but rather the files.
## Building
Clone the repository. Run the script and you're good to go.
